      <h3>About Refuge</h3>
      <p>
        Refuge is a fundraising platform working in solidarity with grass- roots
        and non-profit organizations.

      <p>
        Since 2015, we have donated over â‚¬50,000 EUR to community groups in
        Berlin, by raising money at our basement parties, week- end-long raves,
        and a street food festival.
